                        I am Oscar Cansino, and I am a Senior at California State University Northridge as a Computer Science Major. My interests in Computer Science include Web Development, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Game Development and Data Mining. Outside of class I have a big interest in both board games and trading card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh! and Magic the Gathering. I am also big into building computers, having built my first one from random parts donated to me when I was 11. Some fun facts about me are that I am going to be the first person in my extended family to be a university graduate and I am colorblind.

                                the essential skills that will help me succeed in my future career. In my free time I enjoy working out,
